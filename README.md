# E6530-OC-Big-Sur 11.2.3
Latitude E6530 Big Sur using Open Core. I did not build this working OC install - I got it from OSX Latitude.

# Serial / UUID
WARNING: Make sure you get a new Serial, MLB and System UUID before you start using things like iMessage, iCloud. The included one I generated and the first person to download this may have ownerhsip over it.

# Did it work for you? 
Consider sending a donation to the original author, Jake Lo. I have donated to him each time he helps me, $20 is fair considering how much time I spent rebooting without success. It's up to you! Just mention "Thanks for the E6530 open core with Nathan" in your donation

# More to come
I will continue to update this!
