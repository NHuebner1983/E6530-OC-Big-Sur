# E6530-OC-Big-Sur 11.2.3
Latitude E6530 Big Sur using Open Core. I did not build this working OC install - I got it from OSX Latitude.

# Serial / UUID
WARNING: Make sure you get a new Serial, MLB and System UUID before you start using things like iMessage, iCloud. The included one I generated and the first person to download this may have ownerhsip over it.

# Did it work for you? 
Special thanks to Jake Lo of OSX Latitude.

# More to come
I will continue to update this!
